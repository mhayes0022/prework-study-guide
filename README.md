## A short list of notes

This is the prework for a coding class, which is a list of notes for the coding class. Very meta.

- I built this as the introduction to several basic programming languages; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- It functions as a not sheet for the fundamentals for the class. Hopefully I will remember to continue coming back here and add to the list of notes, but we'll see where my ADHD takes me. 
- Through this I learned rudimentary command line commands, how to use Git Hub, and Git bash. I also learned the basic starting blocks of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
